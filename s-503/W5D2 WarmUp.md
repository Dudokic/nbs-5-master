# Ethical Debate on Data and How We Use It

## Debate on Social Behaviour Modeling

An environmental and social agency is tracking data from private smartphones, such as GPS and accelerometer readings, surveillance cameras from CCTV systems, SmartHome devices, etc.—basically, it doesn't get more invasive than this.

There are two goals to this:

- **Environment Behaviour Modeling:** By studying this data and using machine learning, the agency can model which citizens have the worst impact on the environment. This data is then shared with service providers (insurance companies, utility companies, private providers like restaurants, etc.), and these citizens have their bills increased due to their poor environmental footprint.

- **Security Improvement:** By using this data, the company can predict who will be the future offenders (assaults, rapes, etc.), and therefore police departments can intervene by monitoring the potential offender, warning their neighbours, etc.

## Add on Halfway Through the Debate

**It Is Working**: Let's now debate under new circumstances—It is the year 2134. We are not implementing a new system, but rather debating whether we should shut down or not a system that has clearly been working in the past 30 years. The following has been proven true:

- The security classifier is 100% perfect:
    - Every time the police does not address the issue, the citizen commits a crime.
    - There has not been a single crime committed by someone whom the system did not flag.

- Only some countries implemented the Environment Behaviour Modeling system. In these countries:
    - We have seen an improvement in many environmental measures (air quality, etc.).
    - We have seen an improvement in the overall health of the population (it is 2134; we can measure these things now).

The debate is not whether it was the system or other variables — it was clearly the systems we put in place.

The question remains: **Do we shut down the system? Do you keep your opinion?**
